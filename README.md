<details><summary>How do I play?</summary>

  The turn starts by rolling 4 binary dice, which is done automatically. That
  results in a number from 0 to 4. The current team gets to move one of their
  pieces by that many tiles.

  All of your pieces start on position 0 (the space just before tile 1). Your
  goal is to get all seven of them off the board by moving them onto position
  15 (the space just after tile 14). This is called "**ascending**" a piece.
  You also want to prevent your opponent from ascending their pieces.

  You will move your pieces along the tiles from tile 1 to tile 14. The tiles
  on your side of the board (tiles 1 through 4, 13, and 14) are safe — only your
  pieces can be there. However, the tiles in the middle (tiles 5 through 12)
  are unsafe — your opponent's pieces can also be here. If one team's piece
  lands on the same tile as another team's piece, the piece that was landed on
  is **captured**! It goes all the way back to position 0.

  If you land on a **rosette** (tiles 4, 8, and 14), your team gets to take
  another turn. Also, a piece that is on the rosette on tile 8 *cannot be
  captured*.
