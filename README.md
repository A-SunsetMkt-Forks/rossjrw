## Rules of the game

It's the **:white_circle:white** team versus the **:black_circle:black**
team.

The first team to **:rocket:ascend** all 7 of their pieces **:crown:wins**.
Your goal is to achieve that, and to block the other team from doing the
same.

_(Learn more about the rules of the Royal Game of Ur at
[RoyalUr.net/learn](https://royalur.net/learn/), or watch [Tom Scott play
against Irving Finkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I) in
2017.)_

### Movement

Each turn starts by rolling 4 binary dice, which results in a number from 0
to 4. The current team gets to move one of their pieces by that many tiles.

All 14 pieces start on position 0 (the space just before tile 1).

### :rocket:Ascension

Moving a piece onto position 15 (the imaginary space after tile 14) causes
that piece to leave the board forever. This is **:rocket:ascension**, and
is the goal of the game &mdash; the first team to ascend all 7 of their
pieces wins.

### :crossed_swords:Capturing

You will move your pieces along the tiles from tile 1 to tile 14.

The tiles on your side of the board (tiles 1 through 4, 13, and 14) are
safe &mdash; only your pieces can be there. However, the tiles in the
middle (tiles 5 through 12) are unsafe &mdash; your opponent's pieces can
also be here. If one team's piece lands on the same tile as another team's
piece, the piece that was landed on is **:crossed_swords:captured**! It
goes all the way back to position 0.

### :rosette:Rosettes

If a piece lands on a **:rosette:rosette** (tiles 4, 8, and 14), that team
gets to immediately take another turn.

A piece that is on the rosette on tile 8 *cannot be
**:crossed_swords:captured***. A piece trying to capture it will simply
bounce off onto tile 9.

## How to play

Playing Ur on my GitHub profile is easy. The dice have already been rolled
for you &mdash; all you have to do is decide what to do with them. Anyone
with a GitHub account can play.

Anyone can join either team at any time, but once you're in a team, you're
locked into it until the game ends. You won't be able to play a move when
it's the other team's turn.

The list of links below the board image shows each possible move. Clicking
one of those will take you to a page where you can create an issue in this
repository, where all you have to do is click submit to play your move.

It will take a moment for Github Actions to acknowledge your move, but once
it does, you'll see it react with the 'eyes' emoji (:eyes:). A few seconds
later it will react with the 'rocket' emoji (:rocket:) to let you know that
your move was successful, then leave a comment explaining what happened,
and it'll also make a commit to record your move.

_(If you don't see any of that, then something went wrong. Ping me in your
issue by typing `cc @rossjrw`, and I'll take a look.)_

Note that if your team has no possible moves &mdash; for example by rolling a 0
&mdash; your turn will be automatically skipped. The event log will let you
know if this has happened.
